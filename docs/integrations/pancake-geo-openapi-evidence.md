# Pancake geo OpenAPI evidence

Status: **the fingerprinted Pancake POS OpenAPI document establishes the structural province → district → commune read contract, and the first strict read-only server gateway has been implemented against that evidence. The product policy for Vietnam old/new administrative identifiers remains intentionally separate from this low-level contract.**

## Source fingerprint

The supplied raw JSON has the same fingerprint already used by the reviewed create-order evidence workflow:

- SHA-256 `44916312beb9f6d23ec96ac2ef4cf6428274ca024708f23afd19794ecddba81f`;
- size `2,774,602` bytes;
- OpenAPI `3.1.0`;
- title `Pancake POS Open API`;
- version `1.0.0`;
- production server `https://pos.pages.fm/api/v1`;
- API authentication: query parameter `api_key`.

The raw external document is not committed. The checked-in `pancake-geo-contract-observed.json` contains only the sanitized structural subset needed for review and implementation.

## Machine-derived geo contract

### Provinces

`GET /geo/provinces`

Query parameters:

- `country_code: string` — required;
- `is_new: boolean` — optional;
- `all: boolean` — optional.

HTTP `200` JSON shape:

```text
{
  data: Array<{
    id: string
    name: string
    name_en?: string
    new_id?: string
  }>
}
```

### Districts

`GET /geo/districts`

Query parameters:

- `province_id: string` — required.

HTTP `200` JSON shape:

```text
{
  data: Array<{
    id: string
    name: string
    name_en?: string
    province_id: string
  }>
}
```

### Communes

`GET /geo/communes`

Query parameters:

- `district_id: string` — required;
- `province_id: string` — required.

HTTP `200` JSON shape:

```text
{
  data: Array<{
    id: string
    name: string
    name_en?: string
    district_id: string
    province_id: string
    new_id?: string
    postcode?: string
  }>
}
```

The important contract correction versus the earlier unknown state is that commune lookup requires **both** the selected district ID and its province ID.

## Manual semantic review

The raw document describes:

- `country_code=84` as Vietnam;
- `province_id` for district lookup as the province ID returned by `GET /geo/provinces`;
- `district_id` and `province_id` for commune lookup as IDs returned by the preceding geo reads;
- province `is_new` as “New province (for country Viet Nam)”;
- province `all` as including old and new provinces;
- `new_id` fields on province/commune records.

The document therefore exposes an administrative-version choice for Vietnam. This evidence does **not** establish which old/new mode LA Clothing should present to shoppers, nor that a mixed old/new hierarchy is valid. The low-level gateway preserves the documented parameters without silently choosing that product policy.

The raw commune example also shows `new_id` and `postcode` as `null` even though their structural schema says `string`. Checkout does not need those fields, so the first production parser deliberately does not expose them instead of widening the public contract around inconsistent optional metadata.

## Gateway implementation constraints

The server-side gateway built from this evidence must:

- keep `api_key` server-only through the existing `PancakeClient`;
- build only the three fixed geo paths above;
- require explicit caller input for documented lookup parameters;
- validate third-party response payloads before returning data;
- expose only IDs/names and parent IDs required for hierarchy selection;
- reject malformed, duplicate or wrong-parent records instead of silently repairing them;
- remain read-only and perform no Pancake write;
- not treat examples/default values as browser authority.

## Implemented gateway boundary

`src/integrations/pancake/geo.ts` now implements the evidence-backed read boundary:

- province lookup always requires an explicit `countryCode`; optional `isNew` / `all` flags are omitted unless the caller deliberately supplies them;
- district lookup sends exactly `province_id`;
- commune lookup sends exactly both `district_id` and `province_id`;
- lookup identifiers must be non-empty, already-trimmed strings no longer than 64 characters before any network read;
- third-party response `data` must be an array of at most 1,000 entries;
- response IDs must be non-empty, already-trimmed strings no longer than 64 characters;
- display names are trimmed and bounded to 256 characters;
- duplicate IDs, malformed rows and parent-ID mismatches fail closed as `MALFORMED_GEO_RESPONSE`;
- only the hierarchy fields required by checkout are returned; `name_en`, `new_id`, `postcode` and unknown external fields are not propagated.

The gateway uses the existing `PancakeClient` read method, which owns the fixed Pancake base URL, server-side `api_key`, timeout, redirect rejection and URL query encoding. No Pancake write is introduced by this slice.

## TDD evidence

- Clean RED: commit `7dfaed771ec0792da50cc69a43c31fee049030f9`, CI **#549 / 31579419917**. Database 64/64, all three HTTP smokes, lint and admin accessibility passed; typecheck failed only because `src/integrations/pancake/geo.ts` did not exist.
- GREEN gateway implementation: commit `8079813f3ba5c8714642f744b735cfd47c3721c2`, CI **#550 / 31579737424**. Database, all three HTTP smokes, lint, typecheck, full domain/integration tests, production build and admin accessibility all passed.
- A follow-up regression also verifies that non-boolean province-mode values are rejected at runtime when a JavaScript caller bypasses TypeScript. The final PR-head CI must remain green after that test and this documentation update.

Visible checkout selectors remain a later slice. They should be activated only after the LA Clothing Vietnam old/new administrative policy is explicit.
