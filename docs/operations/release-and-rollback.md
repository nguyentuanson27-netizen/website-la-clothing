# LA Clothing release and rollback runbook

Production infrastructure is defined by [ADR 0002](../decisions/0002-vps-production-infrastructure.md) and amended for the selected shared VPS by [ADR 0003](../decisions/0003-shared-host-npm-edge.md). The active edge is nginx-proxy-manager (NPM) on host 80/81/443, with LA Clothing's Caddy running internal-only behind it. [ADR 0001](../decisions/0001-production-infrastructure.md) remains historical context for the superseded Render decision.

Host provisioning is documented in [VPS bootstrap handoff](./vps-bootstrap.md).

## Release model

Production does not auto-deploy a moving branch. Every release uses one reviewed, CI-green, full 40-character Git SHA.

`deploy/vps/.env.production` contains `RELEASE_SHA`. `bash deploy/vps/deploy.sh` refuses to continue if the checked-out commit differs or the worktree is dirty.

## Release gate

A candidate is eligible only when all of these are true:

1. Human review/approval exists for the exact candidate.
2. CI is green on that exact commit, including normal application gates and the VPS Docker/Compose smoke.
3. The production domain and server configuration are known.
4. `deploy/vps/.env.production` contains real production values and is protected on the VPS.
5. `EDGE_NETWORK_NAME` identifies the existing NPM Docker network and `EDGE_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDR` contains the smallest reviewed stable NPM trust range. Do not deploy the documentation-only fallbacks `la-clothing-edge-unconfigured` or `192.0.2.1/32`.
6. NPM is attached to that network and the LA Clothing Proxy Host is configured to forward `APP_DOMAIN` to `http://la-clothing-caddy:80` without changing unrelated live proxy hosts.
7. PostgreSQL/Caddy image references have been reviewed/pinned for the host.
8. Migration changes since the current deployment have been reviewed.
9. Off-site backup is configured and a restore drill has succeeded; destructive migrations additionally have a release-specific recovery plan.
10. The previous known-good application SHA/image is recorded and retained locally.
11. The controlled Pancake production write acceptance has completed; a read-only contract probe alone is insufficient.
12. VPS host firewall/SSH/NPM/TLS/monitoring prerequisites in `vps-bootstrap.md` are satisfied.

## Production configuration preflight

The canonical application preflight remains:

```bash
pnpm release:check
```

On VPS it is run inside the `ops` Docker target with the real production environment before migration. It validates PostgreSQL URL shape, Better Auth URL/secret/trusted IP header, Pancake configuration, and shipping policy without printing secret values.

Production uses:

```text
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://<production-domain>
BETTER_AUTH_IP_HEADER=x-la-client-ip
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...@postgres:5432/...
EDGE_NETWORK_NAME=<existing NPM Docker network>
EDGE_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDR=<reviewed NPM trust CIDR>
```

NPM terminates public TLS and appends the forwarding chain. Caddy accepts traffic only over its Docker networks, trusts the configured NPM CIDR with strict right-to-left `X-Forwarded-For` parsing, and overwrites `X-LA-Client-IP` before proxying to Next.js.

Cloudflare remains DNS-only for the initial launch. If Cloudflare proxying is enabled later, that trust must be handled at the NPM edge in a separately reviewed change.

## Standard release

1. Record current known-good SHA and candidate SHA.
2. Confirm review/CI for the candidate.
3. Review migrations and database recovery requirements.
4. Confirm off-site backup/restore evidence and current backup freshness.
5. Confirm Pancake controlled production acceptance is complete.
6. Confirm the existing NPM stack is healthy and its unrelated proxy hosts are unchanged.
7. Confirm the external edge network exists and NPM is attached.
8. Confirm the LA Clothing NPM Proxy Host targets `http://la-clothing-caddy:80` and owns certificate/HTTPS redirect for `APP_DOMAIN`.
9. On VPS, fetch and detach at the exact candidate SHA; confirm clean worktree.
10. Set `RELEASE_SHA`, `EDGE_NETWORK_NAME`, and `EDGE_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDR` in protected `deploy/vps/.env.production` to the reviewed values.
11. Run:

   ```bash
   bash deploy/vps/deploy.sh
   ```

12. The helper validates Compose, builds exact-SHA images, starts/waits for PostgreSQL, runs production `release:check`, creates a pre-migration custom-format dump, deploys Prisma migrations, starts the exact app/Caddy stack, and waits for `/shop` application health.
13. Verify public HTTPS and non-destructive buyer-flow smoke through **NPM -> Caddy -> app**.
14. Verify Caddy exposes no host ports and client-IP/rate-limit behavior is not collapsed to the NPM container address.
15. Review NPM/Caddy/application/PostgreSQL logs and container health.
16. Record post-release evidence before declaring success.

Do not create a live Pancake order merely as a generic release smoke test. The write acceptance is a controlled, separately recorded gate.

## Rollback triggers

Rollback/recovery is required for material user harm or integrity/security risk, including:

- the app container cannot become healthy;
- public critical buyer flows fail after promotion;
- NPM -> Caddy routing or TLS for the LA Clothing host fails after launch changes;
- client-IP attribution is incorrect enough to break or weaken auth/rate limiting;
- new auth/authz/security failure is observed;
- a migration causes data/read/write integrity issues;
- checkout/Pancake telemetry shows a release-caused unsafe state.

## Application-only rollback

When schema/data remain compatible with the previous application:

```bash
bash deploy/vps/rollback.sh <PREVIOUS_APPROVED_FULL_SHA>
```

The previous exact image must already exist locally. The rollback helper does not rebuild old code during the incident.

After rollback:

- wait for `/shop` health;
- verify public HTTPS through NPM and critical read/checkout/tracking flows;
- inspect NPM/Caddy/application logs/error state;
- record the failed candidate and rollback SHA.

Do not automatically reverse additive migrations.

NPM route/certificate rollback is a separate host operation. Do not revert or restart unrelated shared proxy hosts while rolling back LA Clothing.

## Database/data recovery

Application rollback is not database rollback.

For destructive/incompatible migrations or damaged data, use the release-specific recovery plan. Restore the selected logical/off-site backup into an isolated target first, validate it, then deliberately switch the application database only after the recovery point is understood.

Never invent a reverse migration while responding to an incident.

## Pancake write safety during rollback

Application or database rollback does not undo a Pancake order accepted by the external POS.

For an order in `SYNC_UNKNOWN`, never issue a blind duplicate create request. Use the existing status/reconciliation path to determine the remote outcome before any additional write.

## Post-release evidence

Record without secrets:

- exact deployed application SHA;
- GitHub CI run for that SHA;
- runtime Docker image tag/digest;
- PostgreSQL and Caddy image digests;
- NPM stack/version identifier where available;
- selected NPM Docker network and reviewed trust CIDR;
- NPM Proxy Host target `la-clothing-caddy:80` and TLS status;
- `release:check` pass/fail;
- migration set applied;
- local pre-migration dump path/checksum;
- off-site backup freshness / restore-drill reference;
- `/shop` health result;
- domain/TLS status;
- public non-destructive smoke result;
- client-IP attribution/rate-limit sanity result;
- NPM/Caddy/app/database telemetry review;
- Pancake production-acceptance evidence;
- previous known-good SHA retained for rollback;
- any rollback or `SYNC_UNKNOWN` reconciliation performed.

## Host-only work not performed by repository automation

The repository cannot claim these complete until observed on the real VPS:

- OS hardening/patching;
- SSH/firewall configuration;
- Docker Engine/Compose installation;
- existing NPM inventory and safe network attachment;
- LA Clothing NPM Proxy Host and certificate issuance;
- production DNS;
- real secret installation;
- off-site backup scheduling and restore drill;
- external uptime/disk/backup/NPM alerting;
- controlled Pancake create -> verify -> cancel acceptance;
- first real production deploy and public smoke.
