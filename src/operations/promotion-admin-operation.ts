/**
 * The promotion admin mutation funnel (#151 G2, master-plan unit U40).
 *
 * Every promotion Server Action runs the same way: re-authorize on the server, hand the decision to
 * the P4 service, translate whatever comes back, and emit a bounded signal for anything refused.
 *
 * It lives here, outside `src/app/admin/promotions/actions.ts`, for one reason: a `"use server"`
 * module cannot be imported by a test. Leaving the funnel in the action file would leave its
 * emission provable only by reading the source, and a signal that is only asserted structurally is
 * a signal nobody has watched fire. Everything Next-specific — the `"use server"` boundary, the
 * session lookup, `revalidatePath` — is injected, so the action file keeps owning the wiring and
 * this file owns the order of operations.
 *
 * The order is the security property `tests/domain/promotion-admin-actions-structure.test.ts`
 * pins: nothing the caller supplied is parsed, read or acted on until `authorize()` has resolved.
 *
 * Two rules follow from that and are enforced here rather than left to call-site discipline:
 *
 * 1. **Nothing request-derived is logged before authorization succeeds.** `campaignId` arrives as a
 *    raw form field, and `isBoundedPromotionIdentifier` only says it is short — not that it names a
 *    campaign, and not that the caller was entitled to name one. Attaching it to a refusal an
 *    unauthenticated caller triggered would let anyone with the URL write chosen strings into
 *    promotion telemetry and mis-attribute refusals to a campaign they never touched. So the
 *    identifier is only put in a signal on the far side of `authorize()`.
 * 2. **An unauthenticated request produces no promotion signal at all.** It never reached the
 *    promotion domain, so it has no promotion outcome to report; the auth layer owns that event.
 *    An authenticated non-admin is a different fact worth one bounded, categorical line, and its
 *    volume is bounded by real sessions. Both still return the same `FORBIDDEN` outcome to the
 *    browser — the response must not disclose which of the two happened.
 *
 * The activation gate is reported by the operation itself, through `reportActivationGate` on the
 * context, rather than inferred from the action's label. An action label is too coarse: `edit`
 * routes to `editScheduledPromotionCampaign`, whose outcome the gate decides, only when the
 * campaign is Scheduled — a Draft edit, a malformed input or a missing campaign never reaches a
 * gate-governed path, and stamping gate state on those would claim a bearing the flag does not
 * have.
