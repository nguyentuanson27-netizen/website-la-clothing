/**
 * Bounded, redacted promotion signals (#151 G2, master-plan unit U40).
 *
 * The promotion admin surface already returns precise typed failures, and that precision is right
 * where it lands: `PromotionAdminFailure` names the exact catalog rows an admin has to fix. A log
 * is a different audience with different rules. `NO_EFFECTIVE_DISCOUNT`, `UNUSABLE_BASE_PRICE` and
 * `OVERLAPPING_CAMPAIGN` each carry an **unbounded array of internal identifiers**, so writing a
 * failure straight to stdout would publish catalog identifiers at whatever volume a bad campaign
 * happens to produce.
 *
 * This module is the reduction that makes those failures loggable. What it bounds is *volume and
 * shape*, not the existence of identifiers: `docs/specs/promotions-flash-sale-v1.md` §Observability
 * names "campaign ID, target type/ID, variant ID, bounded reason code" as useful context and
 * forbids "customer address/phone/secrets/session handles or raw quote proof". A signal that
 * reduced everything to a count would obey a stricter rule than the spec asks for and would leave
 * an operator holding `OVERLAPPING_CAMPAIGN affectedCount=1` with no way to find the campaign that
 * conflicted. So identifiers survive, capped at `MAX_REPORTED_SIGNAL_IDENTIFIERS` per signal and
 * each individually length-bounded, with the untruncated total kept alongside so a sample is never
 * mistaken for the whole.
 *
 * It exists as a function rather than a convention because
 * `docs/decisions/0002-vps-production-infrastructure.md` states the redaction policy in prose, and
 * prose does not fail a test when a future field carries an unbounded value into a signal.
 *
 * Event names follow the existing `pancake_order.*` convention, and emission follows
 * `pancake-order-submit-runtime.ts`: one JSON object per line on stdout, which
 * `docs/decisions/0002-vps-production-infrastructure.md` names as the collected stream. The writer
 * is injectable so the shaping and the emission can both be asserted without capturing stdout.
