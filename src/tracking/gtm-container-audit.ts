/**
 * U28 / T8 — the static gate on a checked-in GTM container export.
 *
 * The storefront may not load a container that has not been proved safe from its own artifact. This
 * module is that proof: it reads an exported container version and answers whether this exact JSON
 * may be loaded. Everything downstream — the loader, the CSP origins, preview enablement — is gated
 * on it, so it is written as a security control rather than a linter.
 *
 * Two design choices follow from that, and both are deliberate:
 *
 * **It fails closed on anything it does not understand.** Google's published export schema could not
 * be fetched in the environment this was written in, so the parser is pinned to the one export
 * format it was written against and refuses what it cannot account for at every level: a malformed
 * shape, a tag whose type it has no reviewed parser for, and — the level easiest to forget — a
 * populated top-level collection of the container version itself. A saved version carries more than
 * `tag`, `trigger` and `variable`: a `zone` links a whole child container whose tags never appear in
 * this version's `tag[]`, and `gtagConfig` carries Google tag settings that change what destinations
 * receive. Auditing only the collections this parser reads would certify an artifact by ignoring the
 * parts of it that do the delivering, so unaccounted-for collections are refused by name.
 *
 * **It keeps vendor identity all the way through.** Approval is checked field by field against the
 * vendor that field belongs to, and a Google Ads conversion is approved as a whole `(id, label)`
 * pair. Flattening the approved ids into one set would prove only that a literal appears somewhere
 * among them — not that a GA4 field names a GA4 property, or that a reviewed Ads account is
 * reporting a reviewed conversion action.
 *
 * **It collects every violation.** An operator fixing a container wants the whole list, not the
 * first problem; and a partial list invites a second review round that believes it is the last.
 *
 * **One rule is deliberately not positive proof, and it is worth naming.** The Meta scan matches
 * known markers — `fbq(`, `fbevents`, and the rest — so a Meta integration authored around them
 * would not trip it. It is a second line rather than the control: the control is the tag-type
 * allowlist, which refuses Custom HTML and every gallery template outright, and that is what a Meta
 * payload would have to arrive as. Read the Meta finding as a helpful diagnosis of *why* a tag is
 * refused, never as the reason it is safe to accept one.
 *
 * Tag Assistant is not a substitute for any of this. It observes one preview session; these rules
 * bind the artifact that will be published.

 *
 * A gallery template does not either, but for a different reason, and the distinction matters. The

 * Pixel runs through GTM* — the only path that admits it is a parser bound to that exact template,
 * identified from a real saved export: its `galleryReference` and a checksum over its
 * `templateData`, reviewed by a person, before any mapping of Pixel ID or event fields is written.
 * Guessing the `cvt_*` type-to-template mapping from a fixture is exactly what that review exists to
