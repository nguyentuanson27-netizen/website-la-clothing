/**
 * W2a: the metadata uniqueness replacement contract.
 *
 * PDP titles and descriptions currently append the canonical slug and the `/shop/<slug>` path. That
 * copy reads poorly in a SERP, but it is doing real work: it is the only thing that keeps two PDPs
 * distinguishable when their published SEO copy — or their fallback copy — is identical. Nothing in
 * the schema makes `ProductContent.seoTitle`/`seoDescription` or `ProductMirror.name` unique.
 *
 * Removing the slug is therefore gated on evidence, not on taste. This module owns that evidence:
 * it builds the slug-free copy a replacement contract would produce and reports exactly which
 * products would stop being distinguishable under it. It deliberately does not change what the live
 * PDP emits; `buildStorefrontProductMetadata` stays the single metadata authority.
 *
 * The discriminators the audit warns against are not used here. Colour, collection membership and
 * similar attributes are not proven unique per product, and inventing one would replace a real
 * uniqueness contract with a plausible-looking guess.
 */

/**
 * B5: the canonical text form every metadata comparison in this repository runs on.
 *
 * Two rules, and deliberately no third:
 *
 * - **Unicode canonical composition.** Vietnamese copy reaches the editor in both precomposed and
 *   combining form depending on the operator's input method, and `"\u00c1o"` and `"A\u0301o"` are the
 *   *same text* by Unicode's own definition. Comparing them as different strings would let two
 *   byte-different but reader-identical PDPs publish.
 * - **`String.prototype.trim()`.** The editor's `parseTextField` already trims before it persists,
 *   and `hasText` in `catalog-acceptance.ts` reads presence the same way, so a value counts as
 *   present here exactly when it counts as present there. That is the JS whitespace set, not
 *   Postgres' ASCII-only `BTRIM`: a legacy NBSP-only row is absent on both sides.
 *
 * Case folding, internal whitespace collapsing and any similarity scoring are **out**. The owner
 * decision (B5) approves uniqueness of the pair, and a looser rule would refuse copy the owner
 * never banned. Widening this is an owner decision, not an implementation one.
