/**
 * The metadata every route inherits, including the social card it falls back to.
 *
 * Next merges route metadata over this one, so a page that builds its own Open Graph or Twitter
 * fields — a PDP with its own product image, title and URL — keeps them. What this supplies is the
 * answer for the routes that build none: the homepage, the collection index, the lookbook.
 *
 * Two things it deliberately does not do. It adds no canonical, because self-canonical for static
 * pages is its own decision gated on the search exposure contract. And it changes no indexing
 * policy: `robots` is the same expression of the exposure gate it always was. A branded share card
 * is presentation, and presentation is not permission to be indexed.
