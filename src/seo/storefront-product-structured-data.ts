/**
 * U27 — the boundary from the PDP's storefront projection to published product JSON-LD.
 *
 * It answers one question: which of this product's variants may appear as their own `Product` and
 * exact `Offer`, either under a real `ProductGroup` or as the exact standalone survivor after a
 * family collapses, and with which facts. Everything it publishes already has an owner, and it
 * reuses that owner rather than re-deriving the answer:
 *
 * - addressability and the variant URL — the U12 deep-link contract;
 * - price and availability — the PDP projection, priced by the same rule the page renders with;
 * - images — the trusted media the catalog already resolved for this product's gallery;
 * - product-level identity — the external `pancakeProductId` the storefront already treats as this
 *   product's public identity;
 * - variant identifier — ADR 0008's manufacturer MPN (`pancakeDisplayId`), kept server-only until
 *   this serialization boundary.
 *
 * Nothing here reads the database. The page repository supplies the projection and the reviewed MPN
 * map together, so publishing structured data adds no extra catalog or pricing query.

 * — offer id, positive price and bounded color/size — gate this exact-variant set too. Without that
 * guard Merchant can have one survivor while JSON-LD still sees two candidates and emits a two-member
 * ProductGroup, which violates the "same exact survivor" requirement.
 *
 * Uniqueness is decided last, over the candidates that survived every other check — the same order
 * the Merchant mapper uses. It has to be: a variant already excluded on its own facts is not a
 * claimant to anything, so counting it would let one doomed row suppress a perfectly good sibling,
 * and the two consumers would publish different sets without either being wrong about duplicates.
 * When two *surviving* candidates share a part number, both are still dropped — the catalog cannot
 * say which one it names, and preferring either would be a guess.
