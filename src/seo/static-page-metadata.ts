/**
 * Self-canonical for a static page, on the terms the existing search exposure contract already sets.
 *
 * Withheld in two cases, both deliberate:
 *
 * - **Indexing disabled.** A canonical nominates the URL a crawler should prefer, which says nothing
 *   useful about a page the same response tells it not to index. The rest of the storefront already
 *   withholds canonical under noindex, and ADR 0004 keeps the temporary production domain there.
 * - **Any query string.** `shouldNoIndexRequest` marks these paths noindex the moment a query
 *   appears, and `/shop` likewise withholds rather than canonicalising an arbitrary query URL to
 *   somewhere the visitor did not ask for. These pages have no paginated form to make an exception
 *   for, so the rule is simply: no query, or no canonical.
 *
 * The origin is the caller's — `readSearchExposure()` reads it from server configuration. This
 * builder has no other source for it, which is what keeps a request-controlled `Host` out of a
 * canonical URL.
