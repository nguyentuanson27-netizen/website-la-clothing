/**
 * The rendered-quote proof: what the buyer was shown, provable by the server alone.
 *
 * P8 persists the *current* authoritative quote. That is not the same as proving the buyer agreed
 * to it — a campaign that ends between render and submission is silently re-resolved upward, and
 * the buyer is charged a number they never saw. This module is the missing half: checkout render
 * issues an opaque token over the exact quote facts it rendered, and submission refuses to create a
 * submit-capable DRAFT unless that token still describes the current quote.
 *
 * Three properties do the work, and each one is a deliberate refusal of an easier design.
 *
 * **It is stateless.** A standard-library HMAC over canonical bytes, no proof rows, no nonce table,
 * no append-only issuance log. Server-held proof state would need issuing, expiring and garbage
 * collecting, and every one of those is a way for a buyer to be locked out of their own checkout by
 * a table nobody is watching.
 *
 * **The cart identity is MAC context, never payload.** The raw anonymous-cart UUID lives in an
 * HttpOnly cookie precisely so a browser cannot read it. Serializing it into a token the browser
 * holds would hand it back, so it is mixed into the MAC input and never into the payload bytes. The
 * token still cannot be replayed against another cart, because a different cart produces a
 * different MAC over the same payload.
 *
 * **It never becomes price authority.** Verification answers exactly one question — does this token
 * describe the quote the server has independently recomputed? — and its `ok` says nothing about
 * what to charge. A caller that read money out of a token would have handed pricing to the browser,
 * which is the whole failure this exists to prevent, so no money is returned from here at all.
 *
 * Canonicalization is byte-exact and self-delimiting: every variant id is length-prefixed, so an id
 * containing the field separators cannot be arranged to canonicalize as a different quote. Because
 * the encoding is deterministic, staleness is decided by comparing canonical bytes rather than by
 * parsing the payload back into numbers — there is no parser here to get wrong, and no path by
 * which token bytes turn into a price.
