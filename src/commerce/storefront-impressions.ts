/**
 * Product-level impression facts for the upper funnel.
 *
 * `view_item_list`, `select_item` and the unselected PDP `view_item` describe a *product*, because
 * that is all the shopper has expressed at those points. Reaching for a `pancakeVariationId` here —
 * the first option, the cheapest one — would report a selected variant the shopper never chose, and
 * would then flow into a Merchant offer match and a conversion path built on that fiction.
 *
 * So one rendered card produces exactly one impression, identified by `pancakeProductId`, whatever
 * the product's variant count. `VariantMirror.id`, `kindKey`, the array index and the slug are all
 * excluded: the first two are internal, the third is presentation order, and the slug is an
 * addressing key that has no meaning in a catalog feed.
 *
 * Money follows the card. The impression is derived from the same options and the same pricing rule
 * the card renders from, so an impression cannot quote a price the page never showed:
 *
 *   - one common resolved price → that exact value;
 *   - a spread of prices → a min/max range carried as first-party facts only, never as a vendor
 *     price, because the minimum is the price of a variant nobody selected;
 *   - nothing resolvable → no monetary fields, rather than a fabricated zero.
