/**
 * Runtime campaign health, derived from pricing outcomes.
 *
 * A campaign is not simply valid or invalid at runtime. Catalog drift affects individual variants:
 * one variant's base price becomes unusable, another gets covered by a second campaign, the rest are
 * fine. The reviewed contract is that healthy siblings keep their promotion while only the offending
 * variant loses it, so health is per variant and the campaign-level status summarises it.
 *
 * Nothing is stored. Health is recomputed from current outcomes, which is what makes recovery
 * automatic: a variant that becomes valid again during the campaign interval is simply healthy on
 * the next read, with no repair write and no chance of a stale invalid flag outliving its cause.
 *
 * No money appears here. This feeds an admin diagnostic, and a report that carried prices would be
 * a second place for pricing to be read from.

 * Resolves current variant outcomes against the database mirror without coverage truncation,
