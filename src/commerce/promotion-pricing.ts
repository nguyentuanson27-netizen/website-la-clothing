/**
 * The central effective-price authority.
 *
 * One semantic resolver supplies storefront, cart, checkout, order audit, structured data,
 * analytics and the final Pancake line mapping. Nothing downstream re-derives a promotional price:
 * a second formula in a card, a cart projection or a feed is how two surfaces end up quoting
 * different money for the same variant.
 *
 * It is deliberately pure and takes an explicit `now`. Reading the clock inside would make every
 * consumer's behaviour untestable at a window boundary, and a storefront render, a cart quote and a
 * checkout reconfirmation of the same request must all resolve against one instant.
 *
 * This module does not decide *which* campaigns apply to a variant — that membership question
 * belongs to the promotion repository. It is handed the candidates and owns the money.
 *
 * `pancakeRetailPriceAfterDiscount` is intentionally absent. Under the approved v1 decision website
 * pricing is `pancakeRetailPrice` plus website campaign state, so a lower Pancake discount field
 * neither sets the effective price nor makes it unresolved.
