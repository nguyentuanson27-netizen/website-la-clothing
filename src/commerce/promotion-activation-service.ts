/**
 * The transactional boundary for effective promotion mutations.
 *
 * "Effective" means a mutation that can change what a buyer is charged now or later: publish,
 * re-enable, disable, and a material edit to a Scheduled campaign. Every one of them must do two
 * things atomically — change the campaign, and advance the durable pricing revision — because a
 * Merchant cache decision orders itself against that revision. If the revision could lag the
 * mutation, stale sale bytes could be served as current.
 *
 * Race safety comes from the revision row itself. Every effective mutation takes `FOR UPDATE` on
 * that single row *before* it reads anything else, which serializes all of them globally. That is
 * what makes the overlap check trustworthy: two concurrent publishes cannot both read a
 * conflict-free world and then both commit. Locking a variant set instead would need the set to be
 * known before it is computed, and would not cover PRODUCT targets whose coverage changes.
 *
 * Serializing every effective mutation is a deliberate throughput trade. Promotion publishes are
 * rare administrative actions, and correctness under concurrency is worth far more here than
 * parallelism.
 *
 * The revision lock alone is not enough, because catalog sync never takes it. A coverage-validating
 * mutation therefore also locks, in one fixed order, the campaign row, then its owning product
 * rows, then the variant rows the expansion probe produced, and re-reads every fact it decides on
 * *after* holding those locks. The order is fixed so concurrent mutations cannot deadlock against
 * each other, and each set is taken with `ORDER BY "id"` so two callers with overlapping sets queue
 * rather than cross.
 *
 * That boundary has a known limit worth stating rather than implying: `FOR UPDATE` cannot lock a row
 * that does not exist yet, so a variant inserted for an already-locked product during validation is
 * not covered by it. Locking the owning product row is the mitigation — a sync that adds a variant
 * touches its product — and per-variant runtime health is what catches whatever still slips through.

 * Non-expanding and non-effective. Target **rows** are copied verbatim, so a PRODUCT target stays
 * one row rather than becoming a frozen list of the variants it happens to cover today — copying a
 * campaign whose product has since grown past the expansion bound therefore still works, and the
 * copy tracks the catalog exactly as the original did. Nothing about a Draft can charge anybody, so
 * the revision is left alone.
