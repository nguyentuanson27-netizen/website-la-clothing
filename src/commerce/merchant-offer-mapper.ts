/**
 * U25 / #153 M3 — the deterministic standalone Merchant offer mapper.
 *
 * One pure function turns canonical storefront facts into Merchant items. It owns no pricing, no
 * stock semantics, no media trust boundary, no addressing contract and no apparel policy: every one
 * of those already has an authority in this repository, and the mapper's job is to consume them in
 * the right order and refuse to emit anything it cannot substantiate.
 *
 *   canonical catalog/storefront facts
 *           |
 *   effective Merchant facts   (this module)
 *           |
 *   Merchant item  |  excluded candidate + bounded reasons
 *
 * The authorities it consumes, and why each is not re-derived here:
 *
 *   - price comes from the projection option, which the caller built with the shared promotional
 *     pricing rule the storefront charges from. A feed that recomputed a discount would be the
 *     second money formula #151 exists to prevent;
 *   - availability is `classifyMerchantAvailability`, the M1 Merchant stock semantics, so feed
 *     counts reconcile with the audited M1 numbers rather than describing a different catalog;
 *   - the landing URL is built and then *proved* by U12's own resolver: the mapper asks
 *     `resolveDeepLinkedVariantSelection` whether this exact identity resolves to this exact option
 *     on this product, so an offer link can never point at a page that would not preselect it;
 *   - media is whatever the trusted storefront resolver already returned. Raw Pancake URLs never
 *     reach this module;
 *   - identity, MPN and XML text safety are the M1 classifiers, under ADR 0008 for the MPN source;
 *   - apparel facts are ADR 0007's resolver, which cannot see catalog text at all.
 *
 * Three things it will not do, and one it cannot:
 *
 *   - it will not fall back from a missing `pancakeDisplayId` to the website-owned
 *     `VariantMirror.sku`. That field is not an input;
 *   - it will not emit `gtin`. A Pancake barcode is a field name, not a proof of identifier type,
 *     format and check digit, so no barcode is an input either;
 *   - it will not invent or silently repair a description, apparel attribute, price or stock state
 *     to make a row publishable;
 *   - and the pure mapper cannot query anything. Repository reads are separately bounded and batched,
 *     so this module itself can never introduce a per-offer database lookup.
 *
 * Composite offers stay `COMPOSITE_DEFERRED` for Merchant v1, exactly as M1 audited them.
