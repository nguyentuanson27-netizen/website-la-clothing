/**
 * U25 / #153 M3 — ADR 0007 effective Merchant apparel facts.
 *
 * One resolver owns the whole O3 question: `explicit product override -> approved shop default ->
 * fail closed`. It is pure and takes overrides and nothing else, which is the structural reason it
 * cannot infer a fact from a product name, a category, a description, a size, a Pancake field or a
 * model output — none of those are in scope here, so no future reader can reach for one.
 *
 * Absence of an override means inheritance, never "unknown". That distinction is the whole point of
 * the ADR: a null column is the approved shop default, so clearing an override in admin removes the
 * value rather than copying today's default into the row, and changing a default later moves every
 * inheriting product with it.
 *
 * A persisted value that is not on the reviewed allowlist is not silently repaired by falling back
 * to the default: it means the stored state cannot be trusted, so the product's offers are excluded
 * with `APPAREL_FACT_UNRESOLVED`. The database enums make that state unreachable through ordinary
 * writes; this check is the layer that stays correct if it ever becomes reachable anyway.
