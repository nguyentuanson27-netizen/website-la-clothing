/**
 * The in-transaction commerce authority for one cart line.
 *
 * Every accepted cart write — the PDP increment, an absolute quantity update, a removal's departing
 * facts — resolves through here, inside the transaction that commits it. That placement is the
 * contract: a rendered price, a `canSetQuantity` pre-check or any other fact read before the cart
 * row was locked is advice, and a catalog, stock, campaign or price change between then and now is
 * caught before the write rather than after.
 *
 * It resolves through the same `getLines` projection the cart page and checkout render use, so
 * there is exactly one answer to "what is this line, right now": one identity, one price from the
 * central promotion authority, one availability rule. A second in-mutation resolver written to be
 * "just for analytics" is how a shopper ends up charged one price and measured at another.
 *
 * The two outputs are deliberately independent:
 *
 *   - `available` is commerce authority and decides whether the write is accepted;
 *   - `snapshot` carries the bounded non-PII facts a caller may report, and never rejects a
 *     mutation. Tracking fails closed; commerce does not fail with it.
 *
 * The snapshot separates the committed unit price from the canonical item on purpose. They fail
 * independently: a line whose mirrored name is blank is perfectly purchasable and has a perfectly
 * good server price, but cannot name a vendor item. Collapsing them would make the richer contract's
 * failure silence a destination that only ever needed the money.
