/**
 * The shared promotional pricing rule.
 *
 * This is the seam where the storefront prices through the central authority. It computes
 * nothing itself: it hands each variant's mirrored base price and its applicable campaigns to
 * `resolvePromotionPricing` and passes the answer back. A second formula here — even a "simple"
 * percentage — is exactly the divergence the central resolver exists to prevent.
 *
 * Two deliberate consequences.
 *
 * The base price is `pancakeRetailPrice` alone. The equality gate on
 * `pancakeRetailPriceAfterDiscount` is not applied, because W3's accepted real-catalog evidence
 * established that Pancake evaluates promotions as dynamic order rules rather than catalog price
 * mutations, so a differing after-discount field says nothing about what the website should charge.
 * A variant that gate used to hide is now priceable and purchasable here.
 *
 * That removal is scoped to callers that opt in by passing this rule. It began as the product
 * page's rule alone; the price-bearing storefront has since converged on it, so today the opted-in
 * callers are the catalog listings/cards (`storefront-catalog.ts`), the product detail page
 * (`storefront-product-detail.ts`), the cart and checkout render (`storefront-cart-repository.ts`)
 * and the guest order snapshot (`guest-checkout-snapshot.ts`) — one rule object, so those surfaces
 * cannot quote different money for the same variant at the same instant.
 *
 * `resolveStorefrontPrice` still owns the two consumers that have not converged: the Merchant
 * identity audit (`merchant-identity-audit.ts`) and the `livePrice` comparison in the outbound
 * Pancake submission (`pancake-order-submit.ts`), whose convergence is P10's to make. Add a caller
 * to the list above rather than reimplementing this projection next to it.
 *
 * `now` is supplied by the caller so one request resolves every option against a single instant.

   *
   * The contract is narrow and worth stating exactly: the callback receives the resolved result and
   * cannot influence it, because the value this rule returns is already decided by
   * `resolvePromotionPricing` before the callback runs. It is not isolated from the call, though —
   * a callback that throws propagates and the rule does not return at all. That is deliberate: an
   * observer that cannot record what it was handed means the consumer's audit would be silently
   * incomplete, and failing loudly at the pricing call is better than persisting a DRAFT whose
   * promotion audit quietly went missing. Keep implementations total.
