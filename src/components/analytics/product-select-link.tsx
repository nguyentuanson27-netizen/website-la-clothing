/**
 * A product card's link, which reports `select_item` for the card the shopper actually clicked.
 *
 * The event is built on the server and passed here whole. That is deliberate: a click handler that
 * assembled an item from rendered text would be reading a price out of the DOM, which is the exact
 * thing the canonical contract exists to prevent. `null` means this deployment publishes no
 * commerce events, or the product had no safe identity, and the link behaves as an ordinary link.
 *
 * Navigation is never conditional on the event. The publisher cannot throw, and the guard below
 * covers anything else, so a blocked dataLayer costs the shopper nothing.
