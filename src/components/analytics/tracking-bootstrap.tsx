 * It establishes, in document order before any page content, the shared `window.dataLayer`, the
 * pinned `window.la_tracking_mode`, and the Google consent defaults — so a container loaded later
 * finds consent already established rather than measuring ahead of it.
 *
 * No Google Tag Manager container is loaded here and no vendor origin is contacted. The first
 * actual GTM load belongs to the unit that reviews an exact saved container version and opens the
 * Content-Security-Policy for it.
